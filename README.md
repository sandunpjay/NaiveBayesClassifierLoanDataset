# Naive Bayes Classifier With Loan Dataset

### What is Naive Bayes Classifier?
A Naive Bayes classifier is a simple and widely used probabilistic machine learning algorithm for classification tasks, particularly in natural language processing (NLP) and text classification. It is based on the principles of Bayes' theorem and is known for its simplicity and efficiency. It has high accuracy and speed on large datasets.

Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the effect of a particular feature in a class is independent of other features. For instance, a loan applicant is desirable or not depending on his/her income, previous loan and transaction history, age, and location. Even if these features are interdependent, these features are still considered independently. This assumption simplifies computation, and that's why it is considered as naive. This assumption is called class conditional independence.
